SAKUA3: How it works.

The website you try to connect would have given you an app / mobile app 
which has a dictionary of words, there server maintains the same set of
dictionaries and a very very large number of it. 

The user trys to connect.

The app is used to select some values from the dictionary, as prompted by
the website.

The browser sends an encrypted message.

The server is connected to another which will have to now guess the 
encryption key based on the encrypted data, real time crypt-analysis 
by brute force is done for the security reasons to prevent MITM attacks. 
The number of dictionaries stored by the server is around some 500000000, 
which makes is nearly impossible for an MITM attacker to decrypt. Also 
every app that the each user downloads, has a different list.

After locating the correct dictionary and creating the encryption key at
the server end, the server responds to the initial message sent by the browser.

Complexities:
Space    - 500000000 * 2MB dictionary size, is very huge
Info     - MITM would have to have the complete set.
Time     - It will take a very large computing horse power to figure which
        dictionary to use.
Uncommon - Every company can create its very own dictionary set.
